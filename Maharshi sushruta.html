        <h1>Maharashi sushruta</h1>
            <p> Sushruta (Sanskrit: सुश्रुत, lit. 'well heard', IAST: Suśruta<sup>[3]</sup> is the listed author of the Sushruta Samhita (Sushruta's Compendium), considered to be one of the most important surviving ancient treatises on medicine.<sup>[nb 1] </sup>It is also considered a foundational text of Ayurveda.<br><sup>[5] </sup>The treatise addresses all aspects of general medicine, while the inclusion of impressive chapters on surgery showcases its importance, it may lead some to believe that it is the primary focus.<br> The translator G. D. Singhal called Suśruta "the father of plastic surgery" on account of these detailed accounts of surgery.<sup>[6][7][8][9]</sup></p>

        <h2>AUTHORSHIP</h2>
        <p>Rao in 1985 suggested that the author of the original "layer" was "elder Sushruta" (Vrddha Sushruta), although this name appears nowhere in the early Sanskrit literature. The text, states Rao, was redacted centuries later "by another Sushruta, then by Nagarjuna, and thereafter Uttara-tantra was added as a supplement".<br><sup>[12]</sup> It is generally accepted by scholars that there were several ancient authors called "Suśruta" who contributed to this text.<sup>[10]</sup>

        <h2>Citations</h2>
        <p>In 1907, an influential translator of the ancient Indian epic The Mahabharata, named Bhishagratna, argued that Suśruta was one of the sons of the ancient sage Vishvamitra.<br><sup>[14]</sup> Bhisagratna also asserted that Sushruta was the name of the clan to which Vishvamitra belonged.<br><sup>[14]</sup> In Chapter 7 of the five-volume History of Indian Medical Literature, published in 1999, physician-scholar Gerrit Jan Meulenbeld covers a variety of theories on Suśruta's identity and the Sushruta Samhita's publication history.<sup>[15]</sup>

            The name Suśruta is listed as one of ten Himalayan sages in a treatise on medicinal garlic that was included in the sixth century CE Bower Manuscripts.<sup>[16]</sup></p>

        <h2>legacy</h2>
        <p> <Sushruta's medical prowess is exhibited through his writings on rhinoplasty, involving nasal reconstructions using skin from the patient's forehead or cheek, often for criminals punished with amputations.<br> Based on reports in the October 1794 edition of The Gentleman's Magazine, published in London, Indians maintained Sushruta's surgical practices until the late 18th century.<sup>[20] </sup>Sushruta is also credited as the first to attribute malaria to mosquitoes, link the spread of plague to rats, and making an early diagnosis of diabetes by tasting the urine of affected individuals; describing it as having a sweet taste similar to honey.,<sup> [21]</sup></p>

        <h2>sushruta on medicine and physicians </h2>
        <p>Sushruta wrote the Sushruta Samhita as an instruction manual for physicians to treat their patients holistically.<br> Disease, he claimed (following the precepts of Charaka), was caused by imbalance in the body, and it was the physician's duty to help others maintain balance or to restore it if it had been lost.<br> To this end, anyone who was engaged in the practice of medicine had to be balanced themselves. Sushruta describes the ideal medical practitioner, focusing on a nurse, in this way:

            That person alone is fit to nurse, or to attend the bedside of a patient, who is cool-headed and pleasant in his demeanor, does not speak ill of anyone, is strong and attentive to the requirements of the sick, and strictly and indefatigably follows the instructions of the physician </p>
